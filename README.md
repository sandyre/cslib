# cslib
Computer Science library (MIT licensed)

Linux build status (clang & gcc, requires C++11 at least): [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/sandyre/cslib.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/sandyre/cslib)

The main goal is to write library, which implements all known algorithms and data-structures, with focus on efficiency and uniformal interface.
Thats said, every tree has same interface, so in your code you can switch between any of tree's implementation and look how efficient it is in
your particular case.

Every algorithm and data structure has comments in it's source file, which includes runtime/space complexities, requirements and interesting facts.

Benchmarks will be implemented in future.
